# Benefits and Perks

## Health Insurance

Detailed information about all 37signals insurance policies and other benefits can be found in Basecamp.

### Medical Insurance

In the United States, medical insurance is provided through Blue Cross Blue Shield PPO. The company pays 75% of the premium and the employee pays the other 25%. Open enrollment is in November every year, with new coverage beginning December 1. Marriages and domestic partnerships are covered. You’re eligible for coverage on your first day of employment. If you are terminated or resign from 37signals, your coverage will end on the last day of the month of your separation date and you may be eligible for continued coverage after that (COBRA).

Each pay period, you’ll see a payroll deduction for medical insurance:

- Employee-only medical coverage: $84.18
- Employee-partner medical coverage: $172.37
- Employee-child(ren) medical coverage: $170.44
- Employee-family medical coverage: $258.66

### Dental Insurance

Dental insurance in the US is provided through MetLife. The company pays 100% of the premium. Open enrollment is in November every year, with new coverage beginning December 1. Marriages and domestic partnerships are covered equally. You’re eligible for coverage on your first day of employment. If you are terminated or resign from 37signals, your coverage will end on the last day of the month of your separation date and you may be eligible for continued coverage after that (COBRA).

### Vision Insurance

Vision insurance in the US is provided through MetLife. The company pays 100% of the premium. Open enrollment is in November every year, with new coverage beginning December 1. Marriages and domestic partnerships are covered equally. You’re eligible for coverage on your first day of employment. If you are terminated or resign from 37signals, your coverage will end on the last day of the month of your separation date and you may be eligible for continued coverage after that (COBRA).

### Health Insurance for Staff Outside the US

If you’re outside of the US and pay out of pocket for private health insurance, you can request reimbursement for 75% of your insurance payments on your monthly invoice. Your monthly reimbursement is capped at the amount 37signals pays per employee per month on the US employee group plan. You may be asked to provide documentation to support your request for reimbursement.

### Life Insurance

37signals offers a $400,000 life insurance/AD+D policy to all staff through MetLife. The company pays 100% of the premium. You’re eligible for coverage on your first day of employment, and it’s terminated automatically on your final day of employment. Open enrollment is in November every year, and participants are auto-enrolled at that time.

### Short Term Disability Insurance

37signals provides a MetLife short-term disability policy to all US employees, at no cost to the employee. The policy may replace up to 70% of your salary on a weekly basis, for up to 12 weeks and up to $3,000 per week. There is a 7-calendar-day waiting period when you become ill or injured.

You’re eligible for coverage on your first day of employment, and the policy will be terminated on your final day of employment.

More information about the policy and filing claims can be found in Basecamp.

## Retirement Plan

Our retirement plan for US employees is with Vanguard. 37signals matches 100% of what you contribute, up to 6% of your salary. You are eligible to enroll in the 401K plan with your first paycheck.

If you’re outside the US, 37signals will match what you contribute to a retirement account in your home country, up to 6% of your salary. In these cases, 37signals will pay you directly via your monthly invoice. It’s up to you to invest that payment and maintain administration of the retirement account and its taxes. You may be asked to provide documentation to support your request for a match.

## Flexible Spending Account (FSA)

The FSA is an account where you can set aside pre-tax money for out-of-pocket medical expenses, such as prescriptions, over-the-counter medicine, vision care, etc. You have to decide up front how much money you want to put in the account, and the max is $3,200/year per person in your household. There is a separate type of FSA for dependent care, and the max for that plan is $5,000/year or $2,500/year if you split this with a partner. This is an entirely optional program. Open enrollment is in December every year, with new coverage beginning January 1. Both FSAs are with Paychex, our payroll provider.

## Paid Time Off

37signals offers 20 days of vacation and personal days plus 11 local holidays every year. We ask that you track your time off. Your vacation time is prorated based on your start date during your first year at 37signals. Your vacation time rolls over year to year with a maximum bank of 27 days at any time. If you are terminated or resign from 37signals with vacation days in your bank, you’ll be paid the monetary equivalent for those unused days (prorated at the time of your departure). Unused holidays are not paid upon termination or resignation.

### Sabbatical

In addition to annual PTO and holidays, every three years employees may take a 6-week paid sabbatical. Give your team a heads-up, preferably three months in advance, so they can coordinate. If you’re terminated or resign from 37signals with an unused sabbatical, 37signals will pay you the monetary equivalent of those unused days only if your unused sabbatical was earned within the previous 12 months.

### Paid Sick Time

We don’t offer a bank of sick days, nor do we ask you to track your sick days. When you’re sick, please notify your manager as soon as you know you’ll be out, and for how long you expect to be out.

If you’ll be away from work due to illness or injury for more than 7 consecutive work days, you may be required to file a short-term disability claim.

37signals does not pay out for unused sick time upon resignation or termination.

Your manager will check in with you if you’re taking frequent unplanned sick days. Excessive use of sick time may result in disciplinary measures. If you have a medical condition that you know will take you away from work regularly, please work with your People Ops team and your manager.

### Summer Hours

We work 4-day work weeks from May 1 through August 31 every year. An employee who has just been hired may have to complete a training program, designated by their team lead, to be eligible. When a holiday occurs during summer hours, you can take the holiday off or your normal summer day off. Any additional days off count as vacation days.

### Scheduling Time Off

37signals doesn’t have a formal time off request process. It’s your responsibility to work with your manager and team to ensure coverage and manage your scheduled workload. The sooner you can inform your manager and team of your planned absence, the better, especially longer absences like sabbatical or long vacations. If your team has a defined process for scheduling time off, please follow that first.

## Family Leave

If you become the primary caregiver of a child, you can take up to 16 weeks leave at 100% pay. If you become the secondary caregiver of a new child, you can take up to 6 weeks leave at 100% pay. You may choose to take an additional unpaid leave as the primary or secondary caregiver. All parental leave must be taken within the first year of the child’s birth or placement.

Some states offer additional benefits to their residents.

## Bereavement Leave

When you lose a loved one, you can take paid time off from work for bereavement, making arrangements, settling family affairs, and attending the funeral or memorial service. Let your manager know your plans as soon as you can so they can arrange for your absence.

You can take ten days of bereavement leave for the death of an immediate family member, and three days leave for the death of an extended family member. If you know you’ll be away from work for much longer, please talk to your manager to discuss that special case.

## Pet Insurance

Everyone has the option to purchase pet insurance through Figo at a 10% discount. There are no set rates, and you can visit our portal on Figo’s website to get your quote and sign up. There’s no open enrollment period to sign up for pet insurance, and 37signals doesn’t administer or contribute towards your policy.

## Employee Profit Sharing

37signals shares 10% of its annual company profits with employees, which is distributed in shares based on tenure. Profits are distributed after the books are closed on the previous fiscal year, usually around March (e.g. 2022 profits distributed in March 2023).

You’re eligible to participate in profit sharing after two years of working at 37signals. You’ll accrue one share per month starting on your second anniversary at 37signals, and you’ll max out your shares at 10 years. We calculate shares based on months of tenure so there’s no unfair cliff between being hired in December vs January.

We ask that you think of any compensation from this program as not something to be counted upon, not something to be budgeted with, but as a true bonus. Year to year, profits and therefore the amount we’re able to share with employees may swing wildly or not be paid out at all.

This Program does not have any set expiration date, but the company reserves the right to amend it or cancel it at any time. You forfeit your shares in the profit sharing program if you resign or are terminated from 37signals before the distribution date.

## Employee Liquidity Pool

There are no plans to sell 37signals or take the company public! But, in the slight chance of that happening, employees may be eligible to receive a portion of 10% of the value of the company if 37signals is sold or made public. That 10% would be divided into shares, and shares distributed amongst employees based on their tenure at the time of the sale/offering.

Employees are eligible for shares in the liquidity pool after two years of working at 37signals. You’ll accrue one share per month starting on your second anniversary, and you max out your shares after 10 years. We calculate shares based on months of tenure so there’s no unfair cliff between being hired in December vs January.

This Program does not have any set expiration date, but the company reserves the right to amend it or cancel it at any time. You forfeit your shares in the liquidity pool if you resign or are terminated from 37signals before the distribution date.

## Laptop Policy

We order a new laptop for everyone hired at 37signals. You can choose the model and specs, within reason and considering the demands of your role. You can upgrade your laptop at any time – when yours breaks, gets too old, or if a more efficient model is released and replacing your machine would benefit your work. Please get approval from Finance before purchasing a new laptop.

## Home Office Set-up

During your first year at 37signals, you can expense up to $3,000 on a new desk, new desk chair, computer accessories, or other office furniture.

When your office furniture needs to be replaced, you can do so with approval from People Ops.

## Coworking Space Stipend

You can expense up to $200/month towards renting coworking space in your city. Please make sure you’re using a true coworking space that’s meant solely for working, not a club or social space like Soho House.

Everyone at 37signals has a subscription to Deskpass, a co-working desk reservation service. You can use Deskpass to find co-working spaces near you, and your $200/month benefit is pre-fixed in your account. You’re not required to use Deskpass to use your co-working space benefit. Your Deskpass budget is capped at $200/mo, but none of that gets paid out unless you book a desk.

## Personal 37signals Accounts

All employees can have a free personal Basecamp account and a free personal HEY account. We’ll comp your existing accounts during your on-boarding process when you join the company. If you decide to sign up for either account later, you can comp the accounts in Queenbee so you won’t be charged. Ping Andrea or Support if you need help with that.

## Expense Account

All staff carry a 37signals Visa card that you can use for work expenses like the benefits described above, software, computer equipment, meet-up travel, or office supplies. Check with your manager or your People Ops team if you have any doubts about whether or not a purchase qualifies as a work expense.

We use an expense management platform called Airbase. You’re responsible for the monthly categorizing of your expenses and uploading receipts for purchases over $75. Full instructions on how to log your expenses in Airbase can be found in Basecamp.


# code_of_coduct

# Code of Conduct

We expect all active 37signals employees and contractors to:

- Assume good intentions. Approach work relationships defaulting to trust and positivity.
- Work “in the open” and be open to teaching and learning from others.
- Be respectful and empathetic, especially when it comes to differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism and direct feedback, and offer feedback in the same spirit.

We expect 37signals to be a healthy place for all staff. 37signals prohibits all forms of discrimination and harassment.

If you experience or witness something that violates our Code of Conduct, please report it to your manager or to your People Ops team via email or chat. All reports will be reviewed and investigated, and your confidentiality will be as protected as possible during the investigation.

If an employee is found to have violated our Code of Conduct, it will be permanently documented in their personnel file. Depending on the severity of the offense and the findings of the investigation, additional responses may include mandatory training, a formal reprimand, or termination. The reactive measures taken will be shared with the reporting employee when possible.

In extreme circumstances, you can report an incident anonymously. Anonymous complaints should be reserved for incidents in which you fear for your safety.

37signals prohibits retaliation against any 37signals employee who participates in a Code of Conduct report or investigation. If you believe you are being retaliated against, please contact the People Ops team.

An important note: Most interpersonal conflicts do not rise to the level of a Code of Conduct report. If you find a colleague rude or difficult to work with, you should address that with your manager or better yet with that colleague directly. Code of Conduct reports are reserved for serious transgressions — illegal or egregiously unethical behavior.

## Politics at work

We respect everyone’s right to participate in political expression and activism, but we avoid having political debates on our internal communication systems. 37signals as a company also does not weigh in on politics publicly, outside of topics directly related to our business. You should be at peace with both of these stances.

## Some Definitions & Resources

- Discrimination
- Harassment
- Sexual Harassment
- Retaliation

The 37signals Code of Conduct is not meant to be a replacement for your EEO rights. You can pursue charges through 37signals channels and through EEOC channels simultaneously. Visit the EEOC website for more information about your employee rights.


# getting_started

# Getting Started

Getting started at 37signals involves a lot of little details, a number of big tasks, learning the details of your new job, meeting new coworkers, all while working remotely. Your teammates, your manager, your 37signals buddy, your Ops buddy, and our People team are all here to help as you navigate your first few days and weeks.

## Your First Few Days

Before you start, the People team will order you a new laptop with the specs you request and any accessories you need like an external keyboard, mouse, or display. Get what you need, while keeping in mind the demands of your work when choosing specs.

A day or two before you start, your manager will email you instructions for your first day. Your manager will be your point of contact for your early projects and activities. You’ll also work with a member of our Ops team who will help you as you set up all the accounts you need to work at 37signals.

On your first day, you’ll log into Basecamp to see a project dedicated to your onboarding called “Welcome, [your name]!”. Your welcome project will contain a few to-do lists, tailored to your role and linking to accounts or services that you need to set up. You’ll also see to-do lists that your Ops buddy and manager will be working through. Your Ops buddy and your manager will be in contact with you as you set up your environment, should you have questions or get stuck.

To keep everyone’s devices safe and secure, we manage all our Mac devices using Kandji as well as our in-house tool Shipshape.

Your training schedules and onboarding expectations will be in your welcome project. You’ll also find docs with helpful links to technical documentation, walkthrough videos, important Basecamp projects, and more.

Your welcome project will also contain a list of people to meet over the course of your first few weeks.

- Your manager. You and your manager will meet on your first day to sort out a recurring 1:1 schedule and to review your specific onboarding expectations.
- Your team. Most teams have a weekly call which you’ll join your first week.
- Your 37signals buddy. Your buddy will be someone who’s not on your immediate team, who’s worked at 37signals for a while, and who can point you in the right direction when you have a question and don’t quite know where to turn. They’ll introduce themselves during your first week, to say hi and offer their help. They’ll check in with you periodically throughout your first couple months to see how you’re settling in.
- People Ops. You’ll meet with Andrea to review 37signals policies, benefits, and compensation.

After your environment has been set up, expectations are clear, and you’ve met who you need to meet, you’ll get to work! You’ll begin working on real projects, with plenty of support and guidance, within your first week. Your responsibilities and impact will increase as you learn and gain confidence over the next few months, and most people are up to speed and feeling fully part of the team in about 3 months.


# how_we_work

# How We Work

## Remotely

37signals is a fully distributed company. Our team works from all over the world, across 5 continents. We don’t care where employees choose to live and work, just that they’re here to do great work on exceptional products, alongside a world-class team. We’ve been remote since we started, and our founders literally wrote the book on the subject.

You can work from anywhere, but please be sure to inform your People Ops team when you move – especially across state or country borders. It may affect your or the company’s tax situation.

## Cycles

We work in 6-week cycles at 37signals. This fixed cadence serves to give us an internal sense of urgency, to keep projects from ballooning, and to provide us with a regular interval to make decisions about what we’re working on.

Our cycle structure is particularly important for the product teams, since they approach feature and product development with scope and budget in mind up front. For more on this, all employees are encouraged to read Shape Up.

All teams operate on the same 6-week cadence.

## Cooldown

In between each cycle, we spend two weeks cooling down. That’s when product teams deal with bugs, when everyone writes up what they’ve worked on, and when teams decide what to tackle next. Sometimes big batch projects extend into cool down, but we try to avoid that.

## Communication

Since we work asynchronously and remotely, it’s important to radiate information about what we’re working on. We have 4 chief mechanisms for doing that.

- What did you work on today? You’ll be asked this question every afternoon, and you’re required to answer at least twice a week. You should describe what you’re working on and give some context about why you’re working on it or why it’s important.
- What will you be working on this week? You’ll be asked this question every Monday morning, and you’re required to answer every week.

Daily and weekly check-ins are subdivided by department so you’re only subscribed to your team’s answers. You’re of course free to subscribe to other team check-ins, but you’re not obligated to do so if you find it too noisy.

- Every team submits a Kickoff for the upcoming cycle, and they’re due the second Friday of the cooldown period. Teams use their kickoff to summarize the work they have scheduled for the upcoming cycle.
- Heartbeats are required of every team, and they’re due on the first Friday of the cooldown period. Teams use their heartbeat to summarize and celebrate the work they completed during the previous cycle, and the work described in the cycle heartbeat should line up (more or less) with the work you scheduled in the cycle kickoff.

These 4 mechanisms work together to free individuals and teams to run their days and cycles with confidence and independence. We have six opportunities per year to make big decisions about what to work on, and the rest of the time should chiefly be spent carrying out those short-term plans. By having clear expectations for communication, it’s easier for everyone to build trust in where we’re going and why.

Heartbeats and Kickoffs are assigned to team leads well in advance of every cycle. Heartbeats, kickoffs, and automatic check-in answers can all be found in the What Works project for the current year.

## Asynchronously

Most of the work you do at 37signals shouldn’t require you to be in constant communication throughout the entire day with someone.

You should collaborate as though most things you ask of others will get an answer eventually, but not necessarily right this second. Your first choice of action should be to post a message, a todo, or a document about what you need to explain or need to know. Then others can read it on their schedule, when the natural lulls of the day allow it, rather than being interrupted right in their peak flow time.

Of course there will be times when you do need to tightly collaborate with someone in real time, but those cases should be infrequent. We have pings, video calls, screen-sharing, or even in-person collaboration for when async isn’t efficient.

## With managers of one

We rely on everyone at 37signals to do a lot of self-management. People who do this well are managers of one, and we expect everyone to embody this principle.

That means setting your own direction when one isn’t given; and determining what needs to be done, and doing it, without waiting for someone to tell you to. A manager of one will spend their time well when left to their own devices. There’s always more work to be done, always more initiatives to kick off, and always more improvement to be had.

## Balanced

We limit ourselves to a 40-hour (32-hour in the summer) work week. Keeping our hours at work limited forces us to prioritize the work that really matters. A healthy amount of sleep and a rich and rewarding life outside of work should not be squandered for a few more hours at work.

There are occasions when teams or individuals need to work off-hours for on-call, maintenance, or emergencies. This time should not be in addition to your normal working hours. Use your discretion to take time off to make up for the additional hours you put in during the week.


# making_a_career

# Making a career

## Your First Year

Congratulations! You’re part of the team!

In your first few weeks, you’ll get aligned with your manager and team on approach and expectations. You’ll get up and running, doing real work. It’s your manager’s responsibility to give you proper opportunities to demonstrate your skills and fit for the job. This includes your technical expertise, your engagement with coworkers, and your ability to take feedback and adapt to the 37signals culture. Similarly, it’s on you to take advantage of those opportunities and to show that you’re capable of meeting the team standards.

When you start, you’ll receive an outline of expected performance metrics. Those standards will be clear and attainable, and your manager will give you frequent, candid feedback on how you’re doing meeting them, as you go.

You’ll have formal performance reviews with your manager at the 3-, 6-, and 12-month marks. On occasion, despite our collective best efforts, it’s not a fit. We don’t do full-scale performance improvement plans during the first year. So if during that time it starts looking like your long-term employment won’t work out, your manager will let you know early and why.

By the time you’ve reached your 1st anniversary with the company, we expect to be as excited about working with you as we were on day one. Likewise you should consider if you feel the same about having joined the team. When both of those answers are “hell yeah!”, you’ll move into a less frequent performance review cycle. Just once a year, around your anniversary of joining the company.

Your first year with 37signals should confirm what we learned in the hiring phase — you’re well suited for this job, and you’re invigorated by the work to be done. Just put in your best effort, make sure you reach out if things aren’t feeling right, embrace the feedback you get from your manager, and openly share your feedback with them!

## Mastery & Titles

Advancing your career at 37signals doesn’t mean giving up on your craft. No matter your role, you can become better at the work itself and level up that way. This is especially important since we’re a relatively small company with few layers of managerial cake.

Within each of our job functions, we’ve mapped our trajectory of mastery to five different levels. That title structure is shared amongst all departments, but the particulars of what characterizes one level from another will of course be different.

- Junior (L1)
- Mid-level (L2)
- Senior (L3)
- Lead (L4)
- Principal (L5)

Mastery and internal leveling are assessed and determined during hiring.

If you’re hired at a level below Senior, you should work towards developing Senior level skills. Juniors should achieve Senior in 4 years (2 to Mid-level, 2 to Senior), and Mid-level contributors should achieve Senior in 2 years. When everyone is able to follow that trajectory, we create healthy, high-performing teams where everyone can trust each other to run at similar speeds. When people aren’t able to level up within the above timeframes, after ample opportunities to do so, we usually determine that to be a bad long-term fit and we’ll decide to part ways.

Once you reach Senior, there is no expectation of further progression to Lead or Principal. In fact, most people will not achieve the Principal title! We see that level as reserved for people whose innovative work creates a resounding impact across the organization and even the industry. Those who do end up progressing all the way through our path usually have worked at 37signals for a decade or more.

The proficiencies expected of all of our major teams by level are documented here: Designers, Ops, Programmers, QA, and Support.

## Pay & Promotions

37signals pays at the top 10% for our industry at San Francisco salary levels, regardless of where you live. The comparison data is provided by a company called Radford that polls compensation data from all the major companies in our industry and plenty of our smaller peers as well.

Some jobs at 37signals are not matched to Radford comparison data. Compensation for common technical roles like programming and design is reliably competitive in a market like San Francisco. For some non-technical roles, compensation is much lower, and much less competitive. To compensate for that industry disparity, we instituted a $73,500 salary floor (floor adjusted for inflation since publishing).

The Radford data is reviewed once per year at the end of November. If it’s warranted, that is if the market rates in the top 10% have gone up, we’ll increase pay on January 1st to follow suit. We don’t decrease pay, even if the market rates may have dropped. If that happens, we’ll hold them steady until they come up again.

Everyone in the same role at the same level is paid the same at 37signals.

When you get a promotion, that is you move from one level to another, you’ll get a corresponding pay raise effective on your next pay cycle.

## Performance Reviews

You’ll meet with your manager for formal performance reviews. When you’re new to 37signals, you’ll meet at the 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year marks. Then you’ll meet once a year, around your anniversary with the company. Your manager will share performance expectations for your role when you start, and they’ll keep you apprised of any changes to expectations should they evolve.

Managers are expected to document performance review outcomes and any action items or deadlines that come out of the meetings.

## Performance Improvement Plans

If your work performance is not meeting expectations, you may be put on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP). We only initiate PIPs if your manager’s concern is correctable in the short term. We do not initiate PIPs for fundamental performance issues that relate to your core job skills. If you’re a Programmer whose coding skills are not at the level they need to be, we’d forego a PIP. However, we may initiate a PIP to help you improve your performance in a coachable skill like project management.


# managing_work_devices

# Managing Work Devices

Everyone receives a new Mac when they join 37signals. We centrally manage and secure these devices with Kandji which reduces our exposure to security incidents. Kandji applies a standard configuration to every device (e.g. enable disk encryption, firewall, password rules), it installs essential apps (e.g. EncryptMe), and it will ensure the apps have the latest security updates applied. Kandji also allows us to remotely wipe devices should they be lost, or when an employee leaves the company.

This doesn’t mean you are being monitored or tracked! Kandji is a configuration management system, not a panopticon.

## Access to code and secrets

Knowing our devices are safe and secure allows us to entrust our work computers with access to sensitive systems like Queenbee, and our internal VPN and remote servers. This means installing the VPN, checking out 37signals code, and storing secrets must only be done on a managed work device, not a personal device.

Please do not keep any personal data on your 37signals-issued laptop. You should maintain a separate, personally-owned machine if you need a home computer. The company reserves the right to and may be required to confiscate your laptop or its data at any point.

## Mobile devices, Windows and Linux

Devices running Android, iOS/iPadOS, Windows or Linux are currently unmanaged. It’s fine to install our BC4 and HEY apps on these devices to access work projects and email, but since they’re unmanaged – and therefore ‘untrusted’ – it’s not okay to store 37signals code or secrets on them. If you’re coding or accessing secure systems, you should be doing so on a Kandji-managed Mac.


# moonlighting

# A Note About Moonlighting

Moonlighting means working other professional, paid jobs outside of your work at 37signals. It’s not a black and white topic. There are one-time gigs, other pursuits, or opportunities that help you grow and make life interesting. We want to support that. But we want to make sure professional endeavors outside of 37signals don’t create conflicts of interest or affect your time, dedication, or performance at 37signals. So it’s a delicate balance.

With that in mind, here are some examples of what we’d consider OK and what we would consider a conflict of interest and not OK:

## OK

An occasional side gig, free or paid, for someone you know. For example, if you want to work on a friend’s website, or a design or writing project for something you’re involved with, that’s fine.
An occasional speaking gig, free or paid. Someone’s going to pay you to give a talk somewhere? That’s fine as long as it doesn’t involve multiple days off for travel (unless you use your own personal vacation time against this travel time).
A side business that’s different from your day job, as long as the commitment is only a few hours a week. If you come to work exhausted because you’re trying to start a full-time business on the side, it’s going to impact your performance here.
Serve as an advisor for another company, or be on a board, as long as there’s no conflict of interest. The time commitment must be under a few hours a month. And if there’s a scheduling conflict, 37signals gets priority.
Do volunteer or occasional pro-bono work for a cause you’re actively involved with. A little work here and there is fine, but, for example, becoming an organization’s full-time web designer and being on the hook to work during your standard work day, etc, would not be OK.

## Not OK

You can’t work full time or part time for another company in our industry. If you’re unclear about what our industry is, and you have a specific situation you’d like to talk about, ping Jason or David.
Go out on a regular speaking circuit tour which is going to require multiple days of travel multiple times a year. That’s too disruptive to our own work schedule and to your fellow teammates.
Consult for other companies in our industry where there may be a conflict of interest (a competitor, a product tangentially related to 37signals, etc).
Be aggressive in marketing your availability for side work. If something comes to you through a friend or some connection, fine, but aggressively promoting something on the side will ultimately result in a conflict of interest here at work.
Take on anything outside of work that’ll pull attention from work. For example, if you wanted to launch an app, but the app requires providing timely customer support to people who use the app, that’s going to eat into your day here at work. That would ultimately be a problem.

## In general

Here are a few guiding principles about whether something could be a problem:

- Is it competitive?
- Does it occupy a disproportionate amount of your time?
- Does it require you to be away during times when you’re needed at work?
- Is it another paid gig that employs the same skills 37signals is paying you for?

In general, we’d like to be lenient within reason, but we’re going to be strict if we see it impact your time, attention, or performance here at work.

It’s hard to come up with one-size fits all rules. If you’re in doubt, please reach out to your manager.


# our_internal_systems

# Our Internal Systems

Besides the customer-facing applications, like the different versions of Basecamp, we have a number of internal systems that help us support, report, and operate the company. They are as follows:

Dash is the main hub for everything that has to do with logging (like finding why a request is slow or whether an email has been delivered), reporting (everything from number of support cases handled to split of devices used to access Basecamp), application health (response times, job queue exceptions etc).

dash.37signals.com

## Queenbee

Queenbee is our invoice, accounting, and identity system. Here you can look up any customer account, see whether they are comped, refund an invoice, or even login as a customer.

That’s an immense amount of power and we take its use very seriously. We only ever login as a customer after having been given explicit permission to do so, never preemptively. Our customers expect that their information is confidential, even from us, and we intend to honor that expectation at all times.

billing.37signals.com

## The 37 command

This is perhaps less of a system and more of an interface to all our other systems. The 37 command gives easy access to the production consoles for all the applications, which is often needed when diagnosing or fixing custom issues. It also allows you to directly grep and tail log files for live debugging, amongst other things.

github.com/basecamp/37

## Sentry

We track programming exceptions on Sentry. When a customer hits a “Oops, something went wrong!” screen, that means there’ll be an entry in Sentry explaining to programmers why they saw that screen. Keeping the exceptions under control and monitored is primarily the responsibility of SIP and Jim via on-call.

getsentry.com

## Kandji

Kandji is how we make sure all work laptops are securely configured and running the latest software updates. It helps us reduce our exposure to security incidents. You can read more about this in Managing work devices.

## Shipshape

Shipshape is the OG in-house tool for ensuring your work laptop is safe and secure. We still run it, but it’s gradually being superceded by Kandji. When you’re given access to the company’s GitHub account, you can run Shipshape to be sure you’re up to code. Shipshape will also test your machine periodically to let you know (and our SIP team know) if your machine springs a leak and needs bailing out.

# our_rituals

# Our Rituals

## Meet-ups

The entire company gathers in person twice a year. We meet up in a different city every time. In 2022, we traveled to Miami and Amsterdam. In 2023, Barcelona and New Orleans. Most of the planning is taken care of for you; you just need to book your flights. Lodging, meeting space, agenda, and social outings will be planned and communicated well in advance.

There are some scheduled talks at every meet-up, like the All Hands session on Monday morning, lightning talks, and peer appreciation. Occasionally, we bring in outside speakers or trainers. Other than that, the meet-up is intentionally loosely structured. Teams huddle in a breakout room for a strategy session, groups go out for coffee or to explore the city, or managers meet 1:1s with employees.

Meet-ups are 1 week long. Most people arrive Sunday, we meet Monday through Thursday, then travel home on Friday. Everyone should come to every meet-up, but skipping one here and there is okay if you have an engagement you can’t cancel.

## All Hands

At the end of every cycle, we hold an All Hands meeting. Everyone at the company gathers on a Zoom call (or in person, at meetups) to hear about product development, business operations, new hires, and anything else that’s happened recently that’s worth sharing.

Our COO runs the All Hands, but many people across departments may present on topics close to them during these meetings.

## Everyone on Support (EOS)

Everyone in the company is encouraged to do periodic Customer Support shifts. We call it Everyone on Support (EOS). Talking directly to customers helps us realize what’s wrong and what’s right with our products. You’ll always have access to our wonderful Support team if you need help writing clear and correct answers to customer questions through Help Scout, our support response tool.


# severance_packages

# Severance Packages

If your employment or contract with 37signals is terminated, you may be eligible for a severance package. In most cases, if you’ve been with the company for less than 1 year, you’ll be offered a lump sum payment equivalent to 4 weeks pay. If you’ve been with the company for over 1 year, you’ll be offered an additional 2 weeks pay for every year of employment, with a maximum of 4 months of severance pay.

The package will also include health insurance for you and your dependents if you’ve been on our policies for the same time periods, compensation for unused vacation time, and compensation for unused sabbatical time if applicable (1 year look back).

Compensation for unused PTO is calculated using your hourly rate. In return, you’ll be asked for a general release of liabilities and other standard employment termination terms. If you’re terminated for cause; such as misconduct, violation of company policies, insubordination or substance abuse while working, you will not be eligible for severance unless otherwise determined by management.
